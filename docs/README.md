## Documentation Standards

This documentation follows these principles:

- **Fundamental only** - No task-specific or temporary docs
- **Single source of truth** - No redundant information
- **Long-term value** - Useful beyond the current sprint
- **Developer-first** - Written for engineers joining the project

## Contributing

When updating docs:
1. Keep them concise and actionable
2. Update cross-references when moving content
3. Don't create temporary "fix" or "task" documentation
4. Consolidate overlapping information
